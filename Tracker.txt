Im not doing anything crazy production wise until a prototype is done

art will be done later otherwise im just using dev assets

DEV TRACKER:

- This is sparse until the prototype is ready

1. movement (including terrain)
2. combat
3. menus
4. more

	Future Features:
		- movement range highlight includes a "fastest path" in like light blue that follows the mouse

BUG TRACKER:

"A bug doesnt exist if its squashed before others see or before you leave your desk, unless it was really funny."
- Vreth

[FIXED] 1. Tiles with units in the sometimes get highlighted in red (intentional but not sporadically)
and the moving unit can move into that tile.
	FIX: 
		The actual movement method allowed the unit to move to ANY highlighted tile, made two methods 
		isMoveableToand isAttackble to differentiate between only blue and red and blue highlights,
		changed the method to only allow units to move to isMoveableTo tiles, since tile highlights 
		semantically will always be enabled when the method is executing.

[FIXED] 2. Tiles with units in them are not being highlighted in red (before team implementation),
has something to do with position of selected unit in relation, and seems to alternate being on and off depending
on whether the selected unit is 1, 2, 3 ... etc spaces away from the unit
	FIX:
		The alg that placed highlight tiles was skipping tiles that were occupied (intentional) but a semantic
		error had it not placing attack tiles either on occupied tiles.

[HIGH] 3. The path preview on the movement preview sometimes freezes the editor, not nailed down but is seemingly 
connected to movinging the preview into non moveable range. Im guessing its overcounting tiles it doesnt need to.
	FIX:
		Not confirmed but i set the path alg  to only pathfind to blue tiles and not red ones, seems to have
		stopped it for now but my intuition tells me its still there somewhere.
		
		Tested with like movement range 10 and still wasnt doing it, still keeping this open just in case.

[LOW] 4. The selected units tile is red when selected.

[MEDIUM] 5. The physical movement of the unit moves it out of line with the tile, might have something to do with
acceleration.
