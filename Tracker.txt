Im not doing anything crazy production wise until a prototype is done

art will be done later otherwise im just using dev assets

DEV TRACKER:

- This is sparse until the prototype is ready

1. movement (including terrain)
2. combat
3. menus
4. more

BUG TRACKER:

"A bug doesnt exist if its squashed before others see or before you leave your desk, unless it was really funny."
- Vreth

[FIXED] 1. Tiles with units in the sometimes get highlighted in red (intentional but not sporadically)
and the moving unit can move into that tile.
	FIX: 
		The actual movement method allowed the unit to move to ANY highlighted tile, made two methods 
		isMoveableToand isAttackble to differentiate between only blue and red and blue highlights,
		changed the method to only allow units to move to isMoveableTo tiles, since tile highlights 
		semantically will always be enabled when the method is executing.

[LOW] 2. Tiles with units in them are not being highlighted in red (before team implementation) sporadically,
has something to do with position of selected unit in relation, and seems to alternate being on and off depending
on whether the selected unit is 1, 2, 3 ... etc spaces away from the unit
